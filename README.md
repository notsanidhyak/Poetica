# Poetica
<br>

> Bytes igniting the literary passion (A beta phase model).
<br>

Poetica is an AI with Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTM) with over 200 cells using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) that can compose Shakespeare-like poetry given the line starter and the word count needed. This artificial neural net has a vocabulary of more than **3800 words** and an accuracy rate of over 80% on it‚Äôs n-grammed training dataset.

### üí° Improvements needed
<br>

The current version of poetica (v1.0) has accuracy of around 80% over 500 epochs and still has a scope of improvement. To contribute to this project, the notebook can be copied from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sanidhyak/poemsbyai) and enhacements to the neural network can be done to raise the overall performance.
