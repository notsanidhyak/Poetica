Poetica is an AI with Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTM) with over 200 cells using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) that can compose Shakespeare-like poetry given the line starter and the word count needed. This artificial neural net has a vocabulary of more than 3800 words and an accuracy rate of over 80% on it‚Äôs n-grammed training dataset.
